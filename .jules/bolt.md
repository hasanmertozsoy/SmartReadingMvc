## 2024-05-23 - Canvas to SVG Optimization
**Learning:** Using HTML5 Canvas to generate background patterns for list items is a massive performance bottleneck. `canvas.toDataURL` is synchronous and blocks the main thread.
**Action:** When generating simple geometric patterns, always prefer constructing an SVG string and Base64 encoding it. In this case, it was ~400x faster (3500ms vs 9ms for 50 items). This eliminates UI freezing when loading lists.
