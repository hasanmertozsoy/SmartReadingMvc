## 2025-12-30 - Empty States & Accessibility

**Learning:** First-time users often face a "blank screen" which can be confusing. Adding a clear empty state with a call-to-action significantly improves onboarding. Also, icon-only buttons (like FABs) must have ARIA labels for accessibility.

**Action:** Always check for empty states in list views and add meaningful ARIA labels to all icon-only interactive elements.
