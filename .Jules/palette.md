## 2024-05-22 - Icon-Only Button Accessibility
**Learning:** Icon-only buttons (like Close, Mute, Favorite) are often overlooked in translation dictionaries because they have no visible text. Accessibility requires these 'invisible' texts to be treated as first-class citizens in localization files.
**Action:** Always audit translation dictionaries against icon-only UI elements, ensuring keys exist for aria-label values, including state-dependent labels (e.g., 'Mute' vs 'Unmute').
