## 2026-01-07 - Icon-Only Buttons Accessibility Pattern
**Learning:** In a React application using `lucide-react` icons, icon-only buttons often lack `aria-label` attributes or visible text, making them inaccessible to screen readers. This pattern was prevalent in the `Reader` and `Header` components where buttons like "Close", "Favorite", "Mute", and "Fullscreen" were implemented as icon-only buttons without any accessibility descriptions.
**Action:** When implementing or modifying icon-only buttons, always ensure they include a descriptive `aria-label` attribute. If the application supports multiple languages, use the localization helper (e.g., `translate` function) to provide translated labels. This ensures that users relying on screen readers can understand the purpose of these controls.
