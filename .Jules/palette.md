## 2024-05-23 - Minimalist Form Labels
**Learning:** In "minimalist" designs relying on placeholders, adding standard visible `<label>` elements often dramatically improves usability without compromising aesthetics if styled correctly (e.g. muted colors, small font).
**Action:** Default to adding `.input-label` classes that are visible but subtle, rather than jumping straight to `.visually-hidden` for accessibility compliance.
